1. What is Docker?

Docker is an open-source platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of applications by using containers.
Think of Docker as a "shipping container" for software. It packages your code, libraries, and dependencies together so the 
application runs exactly the same way on a developer's laptop, a test server, or a production cloud environment.

2. Virtualization vs. Containerization
This is a core DevOps concept comparing how we isolate resources.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Feature             	Virtualization (VMs)	              Containerization (Docker)
OS	                  Includes a full Guest OS.	          Shares the Host OS kernel.
Size	                Large (GBs).	                      Lightweight (MBs).
Boot                  Time	Minutes (needs to boot OS).	  Seconds (starts like a process).
Efficiency	          High resource overhead.	            Very high efficiency.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Docker uses a client-server architecture.

-Docker Daemon (dockerd): The background service that manages Docker objects like images, containers, networks, and volumes.
-Containerd: A "high-level" container runtime that manages the entire lifecycle of a container (starting, stopping, pulling images).
-Docker Engine: The core software that installs on your host. it includes the Daemon, an API, and the CLI.
-Docker CLI: The command-line interface where you type commands (e.g., docker run).
-Docker Client: The primary way users interact with Docker. When you use the CLI, the client sends the command to the Daemon.

4. Docker Installation
Linux: Installed via repository (apt or yum).
Mac/Windows: Installed via Docker Desktop, which includes a lightweight Linux VM to run the Docker engine.
Verification Command: docker --version and docker info.

5. Dockerfile, Image, and Container

These three form the lifecycle of a Dockerized app.
-Dockerfile: A text file containing a list of instructions to build an image (The "Recipe").
-Docker Image: A read-only template used to create containers. It is a portable package of your app (The "Cake Mix").
-Docker Container: A running instance of an image (The "Cake").

6. Docker Hub
Docker Hub is a cloud-based registry (like GitHub, but for images). It allows you to:
Find and pull "Official Images" (like MySQL, Python, Nginx).
Push your own custom images to share with the world or your team.

7. The Workflow: From Code to Container
1. Create a Dockerfile:
Dockerfile
-------------------------------------------------------------
FROM python:3.9-slim    # Base Image
WORKDIR /app            # Working directory inside container
COPY . .                # Copy local code to container
RUN pip install flask   # Install dependencies
CMD ["python", "app.py"] # Command to run the app
-------------------------------------------------------------
2.Create an Image from Dockerfile:
Command: docker build -t my-app-image .

3.Create a Container from Image:
Command: docker run -d --name my-running-app my-app-image

8. Docker Networking
Networking allows containers to communicate with each other and the outside world.

Types of Docker Networks:

1.Bridge (Default): The standard network. Containers on the same bridge can talk via IP addresses. (User-defined bridges allow DNS naming).
2.Host: Removes isolation between the container and the Docker host. The container uses the host's IP and ports directly.
3.None: Disables all networking for the container (Complete isolation).
4.Overlay: Used for multi-host communication (Docker Swarm/Kubernetes).

9. Docker Storage & Volumes

By default, data inside a container is ephemeral (it disappears if the container is deleted). To keep data, we use storage options.

-Volumes: Managed by Docker (stored in /var/lib/docker/volumes). This is the best way to persist data (e.g., database files).
-Bind Mounts: Maps a specific folder on your Mac/PC to a folder inside the container. Great for "hot-reloading" code during development.
-tmpfs Mount: Stores data in the host system's memory only (never written to disk).
